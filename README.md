# Container-Manager

This is a simple container manager that can be used to manage containers. It is written in PHP.

# Possible future adjustments:
### Advanced Packing Algorithms:
- 3D-bin packing algorithms: to optimize the arrangement of packages within containers reducing the total number of containers.
- Weight constraints: to add weight properties to the packages and containers to ensure they meet transportation safety requirements.
- Support for irregularly shaped packages: for handling irregular shapes like cylinder or custom forms.
- User interface and visualization: to provide a UI to interact with the container manager and visualize its arrangement.
- Rotating packages policy: to allow packages to be rotated to fit better within the container.
